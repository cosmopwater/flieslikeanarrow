<u><strong>01/6: Garden-path sentences</strong></u>
<blockquote>
A garden-path sentence is a grammatically correct sentence that starts in such a way that a reader's most likely interpretation will be incorrect; the reader is lured into a parse that turns out to be a dead end or yields a clearly unintended meaning.
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence">Wikipedia page</a>
</blockquote>
That is, the meaning of the sentence the reader usually expects in the first part (of the sentence) doesn't end up matching with the second part. 
<br>
<p>
<strong>
Examples:
</strong>
<blockquote>
Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana
<br>
The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.
<br>
Fat people eat accumulates.
</blockquote>
<em>Sometimes newspaper headlines too.</em>
<blockquote>
Miners Refuse to Work After Death
</blockquote>
<em>One real life example which actually inspired this post.</em>
<blockquote>
XYZ college hosts mock UN conference
</blockquote>

<p>
These sentences are called so referring to an idiom, <em>to lead (someone) down/up the garden path</em>, which means to trick someone or to cause them to think/proceed wrongly. Thus these sentences, though gramatically correct, can confuse the reader, humorously at times.

[When I first came across this topic, I found it quite interesting and wanted a space to share it (and other such interesting things) with others, or just record it for myself. This inspired this blog, whose name, <em> flies like an arrow</em>, is in reference to the garden-path sentence I first found humorous.]

<u><strong>08/6: Calculus and Calculi</strong></u>
</summary>
<p>
In Latin, the word calculus means 'small pebble'. 
</p>
As such pebbles were used for counting distances, vote tally, and abacus arithmetic, the word came to also be the Latin word for calculation. 
<br>
In the 17th century, Leibniz and Newton built on the work of earlier mathematicians and wrote their mathematical texts in Latin, due to which their work on continuous change (in small parts) came to be known as infinitesimal calculus originally, with two branches, diffrential calculus (dividing into small parts, crudely) and integral calculus (adding small parts).
</p>
In the 18th century, it also came to be used for mineral buildups in human and animal bodies, like kidney stones, as in <em>renal calculi</em>, calculi being plural form of calculus in Latin.

<u><strong>01/6: Garden-path sentences</strong></u>
</summary>
<p>
<blockquote>
A garden-path sentence is a grammatically correct sentence that starts in such a way that a reader's most likely interpretation will be incorrect; the reader is lured into a parse that turns out to be a dead end or yields a clearly unintended meaning.
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence">Wikipedia page</a>
</blockquote>
That is, the meaning of the sentence the reader usually expects in the first part (of the sentence) doesn't end up matching with the second part. 
<br>
<p>
<strong>
Examples:
</strong>
<blockquote>
Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana
<br>
The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.
<br>
Fat people eat accumulates.
</blockquote>
<em>Sometimes newspaper headlines too.</em>
<blockquote>
Miners Refuse to Work After Death
</blockquote>
<em>One real life example which actually inspired this post.</em>
<blockquote>
XYZ college hosts mock UN conference
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
These sentences are called so referring to an idiom, <em>to lead (someone) down/up the garden path</em>, which means to trick someone or to cause them to think/proceed wrongly. Thus these sentences, though gramatically correct, can confuse the reader, humorously at times.
</p>
[When I first came across this topic, I found it quite interesting and wanted a space to share it (and other such interesting things) with others, or just record it for myself. This inspired this blog, whose name, <em> flies like an arrow</em>, is in reference to the garden-path sentence I first found humorous.]
